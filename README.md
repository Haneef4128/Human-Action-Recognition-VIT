## Project Overview

This project explores deep learning architectures using:
- **PyTorch** for efficient neural network training and experimentation.
- **TensorFlow** for model building, training, and deployment.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, a transformer-based architecture for computer vision tasks, often outperforming traditional convolutional networks in image classification tasks.

Data for training and validation was retrieved from Kaggle and preprocessed as needed.
